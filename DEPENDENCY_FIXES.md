# Mimir API - Dependency and Build Issues Resolution

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. SQLite/ChromaDB Compatibility Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** ChromaDB requires SQLite >= 3.35.0, but the DevContainer has SQLite 3.34.1.

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Production (Docker):** Updated Dockerfile to compile SQLite 3.45.1 from source
2. **Development:** Added compatibility module with clear error messages and solutions
3. **Version Pinning:** Pinned ChromaDB to version 0.6.3 for better compatibility
4. **Environment Variables:** Set `CHROMADB_ALLOW_RESET=true` for development environments

### 2. Requirements.txt Cleanup ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** Requirements were unversioned and could cause conflicts.

**Solutions:**
- Added proper version constraints for all dependencies
- Organized requirements by category with clear comments
- Pinned problematic packages to working versions
- Added compatibility packages where needed

### 3. Startup Scripts Optimization ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** Multiple startup scripts were redundant and inefficient.

**Solutions:**
- **start-devcontainer.sh:** Optimized for DevContainer environment
- **start-dev.sh:** Enhanced for local development with venv
- **start-prod.sh:** Improved for production deployment
- **startup.py & startup.sh:** Enhanced for Azure App Service
- Added proper error handling and environment validation

### 4. DevContainer Configuration ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** DevContainer used base image instead of project Dockerfile.

**Solutions:**
- Updated `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to use project Dockerfile
- Added VS Code extensions and settings for Python development
- Set proper environment variables for development
- Added proper port forwarding and customizations

### 5. Dockerfile Improvements ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** Dockerfile had dependency issues and missing optimizations.

**Solutions:**
- Added SQLite compilation from source for newer version
- Improved caching with proper layer ordering
- Added comprehensive system dependencies
- Enhanced security with non-root user
- Added proper health checks

## Usage Instructions

### Universal Startup Script

The project now uses a single universal startup script that automatically detects the environment:

```bash
./start.sh
```

**Environment Detection:**
- **DevContainer:** Auto-detected when running in VS Code DevContainer
- **Azure App Service:** Auto-detected when Azure environment variables are present
- **Production:** Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` or `APP_ENV=production`
- **Development:** Default fallback for local development

### Environment-Specific Usage

#### DevContainer Development (Recommended)
1. **Prerequisites:** VS Code with DevContainer extension
2. **Start:** Open project in VS Code, select "Reopen in Container"
3. **Run:** 
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
4. **Data Persistence:** ChromaDB data is stored in Docker volumes that survive container restarts

#### Local Development
1. **Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, pip, virtual environment (optional)
2. **Run:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

#### Production Deployment
1. **Docker:** 
   ```bash
   docker build -t mimir-api .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 mimir-api
   ```

2. **Direct Production:**
   ```bash
   ENVIRONMENT=production ./start.sh
   ```

#### Azure App Service
- Use `startup.sh` as startup command (delegates to universal script)
- Or use `startup.py` as Python entry point

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
- `EC_ADMIN_PWD`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`

### Optional for Development:
- `APP_ENV=development`
- `CHROMADB_ALLOW_RESET=true`
- `CHROMADB_LOC=./data/chromadb`
- `LOG_LEVEL=info`

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### SQLite Compatibility in Development

If you encounter SQLite issues during development:

1. **Use DevContainer (Recommended):** The Dockerfile compiles a newer SQLite version
2. **Local Development:** The compatibility module will show you solutions:
   - Upgrade your system SQLite version
   - Use Docker for development
   - Consider alternative vector databases

### ChromaDB Version

- Currently pinned to version 0.6.3 for compatibility
- Once SQLite is upgraded, you can use newer versions

## Testing the Setup

Run the included test scripts to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test ChromaDB compatibility
python3 test_chromadb.py

# Test the full application
python3 -c "from app.dependencies import app; print('✅ App imports successfully')"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Test the DevContainer setup
2. **Short-term:** Verify all functionality works with pinned versions
3. **Long-term:** Upgrade to newer ChromaDB versions once SQLite is updated
4. **Production:** Deploy using the improved Docker configuration

All startup scripts are now executable and include proper error handling and environment validation.
